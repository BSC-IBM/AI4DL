Here there is the code of AI4DL ready to use, with an example.

## Package Content

The AI4DL package contains the basic code to train and use the AI4Dl tool from CPU/Memory/etc... traces.

### Basic elements
 
 * **AI4DL.py**: Class containing the basic functions and elements for *training* and *predicting* traces using the AI4DL mechanism
 * **crbm_tools.py**: Library containing the CRBM mechanism in Python. It is used by AI4DL class 
 * **timeseries.py**: Library containing functions to plot the traces with and without the phases
 
### An example

 * **example.py** : An example loading a traces data-set, training the AI4DL (complete crbm + clustering pipeline) and printing an example trace with found phases 
 
### Sample traces

 * **sample_traces.data**: TODO - Here will go files with sample traces
